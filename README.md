# README.md

This is a basic project starter for a static website or prototype. It runs gulp to concatenate and minify SCSS and JS files, and it compresses images.

Ways to extend this project:

- Add Babel to transpile ES2015(ES6) javascript for older browsers and IE.
- Add Webpack if the projects evolves to a web application, althought I would recommend using one of the many existing starter kits out there to save time.

1. run `npm install`
2. run `gulp`
